# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

This is my portfolio page, which presents previous projects I worked on and showcases my skills in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It is optimized for search engines and follows accessbility standards. This was done by adding a title of the webpage and adding 'title' attributes to all background images. 

HTML was further improved by ensuring semantic elements are found throughout the code to increase readability and HTML generally follows logical structure.

CSS structure was improved by ensuring selectors and properties are consolidated and organised and commends were added to aid understanding.

The webpage was built using Bootstrap elements to improve responsiveness, meaning the page has good structure and styling regardless of screen size used to view it.
